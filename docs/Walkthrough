   - Prisma ORM controlling a PostgreSQL database schema securely.
   - Robust Excel export mechanism utilizing `exceljs` for the Admin Dashboard.
   - Prisma seed script configured to pre-populate 1 Admin and 4 initial Demo Events.
3. **Containerization & CI/CD**
   - Multi-stage Dockerfiles optimized for both the `frontend` and `backend`.
   - `docker-compose.yml` to orchestrate `frontend`, `backend`, and `postgres` together effortlessly on your local machine.
   - Two complete GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/workflows/deploy-gcp.yml` and `.github/workflows/deploy-azure.yml`) setup for deployment to Google Cloud Run and Azure Container Apps.
4. **Documentation**
   - comprehensive instructions available natively in [`/docs/deployment.md`](file:///Users/sergeaudenaert/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-serge.audenaert@gmail.com/My Drive/CoWork/event-platform-poc/docs/deployment.md).

## How to Test and Run Locally
1. Simply run the following command in the `/event-platform-poc` directory:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
2. The UI will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
3. You can log into the Admin Dashboard using the seeded admin credentials:
   - **Email:** `admin@example.com`
   - **Password:** `admin123`
4. The backend runs on `http://localhost:4000` and the database maps to port `5432`.

Enjoy! Please review the project structure and test the local deployment. Let me know if you want any modifications or additions.
